      <p>The team is located in the exclusive Gentlemen's Club in Orseaux, set in the picturesque region of Aquitaine.
        The club's interior exudes period elegance, adorned with gilded details and furniture maintained in a steampunk
        style.
        Here, the societal elite gather to celebrate art, science, and modern inventions powered by steam and mana.
        However, beneath the apparent tranquility lies many secrets, waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers.</p>
      <p>Game Master, the team learns about the Golden Cushion with the Inscription "Sweet Revenge" through a letter
        from a friend.
        This information arrives at an unexpected moment, as the heroes are in the Gentlemen's Club.
        The task is clear, but the motives and consequences remain a mystery.
        Let the team be ready for an extraordinary adventure that awaits them, connected to this enigmatic Golden
        Cushion.</p>
      <p>The Game Master introduces an initial tension level: 1, as the players enter the Gentlemen's Club.
        The interior pulses with gleaming pocket watches and vibrating sounds of mechanical pianolas.
        Steam rises in the air, attempting to overpower the scent of intense cinnamon mixed with the smells of old books
        and warmed blankets.
        The reflection of light on brass details, ornate paneling, and kaleidoscopic windows makes the entire place seem
        alive.
        The Game Master can now allow the players to explore the club before the next pivotal moment in their adventure
        occurs.</p>

      </p>

      <p>The team is located in the town of Orseaux, where thick steam rising from factory chimneys mixes with the smell
        of burning and metal.
        The narrow streets are filled with people dressed in stiff clothes with worn cuffs, and steam-powered robots
        traversing the city streets, performing various tasks for the urban establishments.
        Looking up, the structures of intricate steam bridges and canals that cut through the sky between the stone
        blocks of buildings.</p>
      <p>The team gathers around a table in a small workshop, which they use as their headquarters in the city.
        You can hear the sounds of pocket watches ticking and the hiss of steaming pipes.
        Each member of the team is busy with their preparations for the mission.
        The mechanical revolver is being cleaned, and the large coat, designed to withstand any weather conditions, is
        carefully checked for hidden supplies.
        There is no doubt anymore - something big is about to happen.</p>

      <p>
        <span class="bold">GM Objective:</span>
        Quiet players, let them savor their victory.
      </p>
    
      <p>The team finds themselves in Somewhere safe, an oasis of calm in the turbulent world of steampunk reality.
        Surrounded by mysterious nooks and full of signs of the past, it is a place that hides many undiscovered secrets.
        There are many unexplored mysteries waiting here, which may be crucial for further developments.</p>
      <p>The team spends time analyzing the treasure they've acquired. They wonder what could have gone better. Reading the
        inscription on the Golden Cushion, which speaks of "Sweet Revenge," evokes mixed feelings in them. Does this mean the
        treasure is cursed, or does it conceal some other mystery? Their thoughts revolve around the mysterious find when
        suddenly they realize that every decision in their adventure so far has had consequences. Was it just luck, or were
        stronger forces influencing their fate?</p>
      <p>After reaching a safe place, the team wonders what's next. Will they try again to obtain the Golden Cushion inscribed
        with "Sweet Revenge," or will they focus on something else? This is an important decision that could impact future
        events. Time is running out, so they must proceed with caution.</p>
